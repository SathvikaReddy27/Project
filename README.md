# Project
This project includes details on various breeds. The adoption list was stored in the Cloud Firestore by connecting the app to Firebase.
We created a form for users to fill out in order to collect information about the adoption pets and used recycler view to display different breeds and an adoption list.
For organizations that post on social media about adoptable street dogs, this application is helpful.
